# Flutter vs React Native

# Overview

Cross-platform development can be done using two technologies Facebook's **React Native** and Google's **Flutter**.

Cross-platform development is the practice of building software that is compatible with more than one type of hardware platform. A cross-platform application can run on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS, or just two of them. 

A good example of a cross-platform application is a web browser or Adobe Flash that performs the same, irrespective of the computer or mobile device you run it on.
